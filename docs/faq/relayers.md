- Will Loopring maintain an official backend relayer cluster?
> Loopring maintains its official relay cluster called **Bootstrap** (endport: bootstrap.loopring.io) to its ecosystem. Please read our Medium post regarding **the World's first DEX alliance initiative**.

- Do we have to use Loopring's relay implementation in order to use the Loopring Protocol?
> Not at all. We encourage developers to implement their own backend solutions. Our official relay cluster is a good starting point for you to learn what need to be done to provide Matching-As-A-Service, or MAAS.
>
> We do recommand different backend to provide a similar set of APIs to make it easy for DEXs and wallexs to share liquidities.

- Can we open-source our alternative relay implementation?
> Of course. If you did open-source your relay backend, we will even reward your developers with some LRC tokens.
